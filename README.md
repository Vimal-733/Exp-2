# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## AIM: To draw a UML diagram for a library management system
## SRS (Procedure):
Actors Used-:

Librarian
Student
Staff
Admin
Software - StarUML

List of Diagrams -:

Class Diagram
Usecase Diagram
Package Diagram
Activity Diagram
Communication Diagram
Sequence Diagram
Procedure-:

Define System Requirements: Outline the functional and non-functional requirements, such as user authentication and transaction processing.
Identify Key Actors and Use Cases: Determine actors and define their interactions.
Design the System Architecture: Break down the system into components
Create UML Diagrams: Develop use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams based on the system design.
Test and Validate: Perform testing to ensure the system meets functional requirements and security standards.
